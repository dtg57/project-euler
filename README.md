# project-euler
Programs written to solve selected Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net), mostly written in Python. To date I have solved 91 problems in total, the hardest being problem 155 "Counting capacitor circuits" with difficulty rating 60%.

Note on files in the 2015 folder: this is code I wrote a long time ago, when I was much younger. Much of it is inefficient, and I have not commented like I would now. It is kept here for posterity :)
